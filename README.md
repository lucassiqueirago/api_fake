Hi, my name is Lucas Siqueira 🇧🇷 !
I am very happy 😁 to share with you the designer at B4XPAGES.

## Install

This code queries currency quotes using the free https://exchangerate.host/ api.

I also implemented a designer with progress while the app makes the http request to get the data via json and upload it to the XCLV.

I hope you like the layout and my contributions! 🤓💻
I'm in love 🥰😍 with B4X!

Made with ❤ in [B4X](https://www.b4x.com/)
